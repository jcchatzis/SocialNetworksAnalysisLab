## Projects



## 1. **Network Construction and Metrics (Lab 1)**
   - **Objective**: Build and analyze complex networks.
   - **Description**: Construct different network models (Random, Scale-free, Small-world) and calculate key metrics like clustering coefficient, shortest path, eccentricity, and centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness, Katz, PageRank). Study network connectivity, robustness, and evolution.
   
## 2. **Node Analysis and Community Detection (Lab 2)**
   - **Objective**: Analyze node characteristics and detect communities in networks.
   - **Description**: Extend metrics from Lab 1 to real-world networks and detect communities using algorithms like Spectral Clustering, Newman-Girvan, and Modularity Maximization. Evaluate communities using modularity and performance measures.
Here's a more concise version of the third project's description:

## 3. **Link Prediction Using Machine Learning (Lab 3)**
- **Objective**: Predict future connections in a network using similarity metrics and machine learning.
- **Description**: 
  1. **Similarity-Based Link Prediction**:
     - Use **Jaccard Coefficient**, **Preferential Attachment**, and **Resource Allocation** to measure node similarity.
     - Evaluate link prediction with **Precision**, **Recall**, and **Accuracy** at various thresholds.
  2. **Node Embeddings and Random Forest**:
     - Apply **Node2Vec** to generate node embeddings based on random walks.
     - Train a **Random Forest Classifier** on these embeddings to predict links. 
     - 
- **Outcome**: Combine similarity metrics and machine learning to predict potential new links in a network.
